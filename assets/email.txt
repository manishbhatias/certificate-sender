Dear {{name}},

Thank you for being a part of Bhumi's activities this year.

Please find attached your certificate, as a token of our recognition.

In alignment with Bhumi's values of being eco-conscious (http://www.bhumi.ngo/about/), we are sending you an e-copy of the certificate. We request you to print the same only if essential. It is recommended that A4 size paper of 250/300 GSM thickness is used for printing.

To volunteer regularly with Bhumi it is essential to register at http://www.bhumi.ngo/volunteer and attend an orientation programme (if you already haven't).

We look forward to you changing today with you!

Niveditha
Bhumi Team
